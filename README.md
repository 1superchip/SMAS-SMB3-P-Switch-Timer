Super Mario All Stars Super Mario Bros 3 P Switch Timer

This is a working patch that displays the SMB3 P-Switch Timer as the coin counter.

This is a WIP patch that will have updates to make it work better than currently does.

v1.0 always displays the P-Switch timer which causes it to be set to 0.

v1.1 displays coins properly when a P-Switch isn't active.
